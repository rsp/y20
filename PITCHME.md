# WASI?

"If X + WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker. That's how important it is. X on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let's hope WASI is up to the task!"

"If WASM + WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker. That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let's hope WASI is up to the task!"
